2 Operation system, code language and version 
This implementation is written in Python. The specific version of Python that this 
implementation is written for is not specified, but it should work with any version of 
Python that supports the socket and threading modules. 
This implementation is not tied to any specific operating system and should work on any 
operating system that supports Python and the necessary libraries. 
3 Theoretical background 
Client-server architecture is a common design pattern for distributed systems, where a 
client sends requests to a server and the server responds with the requested information 
or service. In this architecture, the server is responsible for storing and managing data, 
and the client is responsible for making requests and displaying the results to the user. 
In the implementation provided, the server is responsible for managing the group chats 
and handling client requests. The client is responsible for sending requests to the server 
and displaying the results to the user. The client and server communicate with each other 
using sockets, which are a low-level network programming interface that allows 
programs to send and receive data over a network. 
4 Technical Highlights 
- Server-side: 
server.py contains the code for the server-side of the chat group application. It sets up a 
server socket and listens for incoming connections from clients. When a client connects, 
the server creates a new thread to handle the client's requests and continues listening for 
other incoming connections. 
handle_client(): This function is called for each client that connects to the server. It sends 
the opening message to the client, waits for the client to select an option, and then handles 
the selected option (either connecting to a group chat, creating a new group chat, or 
exiting the server). 
- Client-side: 
The client-side code was included in the server.py file as part of the handle_client() 
function.

To run the client-side of the chat group application, you can simply run the server.py file 
and connect to the server from a separate terminal window. When prompted, enter your 
desired action (connect to an existing group chat, create a new group chat, or exit the 
server). If you choose to connect to an existing group chat or create a new group chat, you 
will also be prompted to enter your name, group ID, and password. 
Implementing a nice GUI (Graphical User Interface) will give you an extra credit of 10 
points. 
5 explanation about the socket handshake â€“ which protocol 
you used, what are the commands, are they blocking 
commands. 
In this implementation, we use the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish a 
connection between the server and client. TCP is a reliable, stream-oriented protocol that 
provides a connection-oriented service for transmitting data between two computers. 
To establish a connection using TCP, the server and client follow a three-way handshake 
process: 
The client sends a request to the server to establish a connection (SYN). 
The server receives the request and sends a response to the client acknowledging the 
request (SYN+ACK). 
The client receives the acknowledgement and sends a final acknowledgement back to the 
server (ACK). 
Once the three-way handshake is complete, a connection is established between the client 
and server and data can be exchanged between them. 
In this implementation, we use the socket library in Python to create the server and client 
sockets and perform the socket handshake. We use the bind() and listen() functions on 
the server socket to bind it to a specific IP address and port and start listening for 
incoming connections. On the client side, we use the connect() function to send the initial 
request to the server to establish a connection. 
All these functions are blocking functions, which means that they will block the execution 
of the program until they complete. This means that the program will wait until a 
connection is established before continuing. 
Once a connection is established, we can use the send() and recv() functions to exchange 
data between the client and server. These functions are also blocking functions, which

means that they will block the execution of the program until they complete. This means 
that the program will wait until data is received before continuing.
